Syncc

A simple wrapper for rsync that allows deployment settings to be kept in
source control. Deployment is done via ssh and the script itself is written
in Ruby.

Simply put a `.syncc` file in your project:

  host: remote-server.com
  port: 2222
  remotes:
    live:
      path: /var/www/production
    dev:
      path: /var/www/development

Then, to deploy the current directory's content (no Git integration is provided,)
run:

  syncc dev

To deploy to your development directory on remote-server.com.

Settings placed at the top level are used with each remote destination. So, if
your remotes are on different servers, simply move the 'host' down into the
remotes individual setting for that alias:

  port: 2222
  remotes:
    live:
      host: remote-server.com
      path: /var/www/production
    dev:
      host: test.remote-server.com
      path: /var/www/development
    beta:
      host: beta.remote-server.com
      path: /var/www/beta
      port: 22

You can also exclude files by providing a list:

  exclude: [.DS_Store]

Some files (such as .git, .syncc and .*.swp files) are automatically excluded
from the sync.
